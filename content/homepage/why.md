AI and accelerated computing are growing

* AI has changed the compute landscape by normalizing number crunching and accelerated
  computing for the masses.

Cloud HPC is growing

* HPC is a growth area, and cloud users need a portable, production- ready software
  stack that can be sustained and advanced over time.

Leverage for cloud and secure supply chain

* A unified foundation for High Performance Software allows us to work closely with
  other groups like CNCF (cloud) and OpenSSF (security).

The HPC stack is ready to fill the gap

* Years of investment make the HPC stack fast, portable, and ready for production. To
  increase its reach, we need to let the world know.
