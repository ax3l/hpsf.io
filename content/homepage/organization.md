![HPSF Governance Structure](../images/hpsf-structure.png)

HPSF will set up a technical advisory committee (TAC) to manage working groups tackling
a variety of HPC topics, and will follow a governance model based on the Cloud Native
Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Initial working groups include:
* Continuous Integration resources tailored for HPC projects
* Continuously built, turnkey software stacks
* Architecture support
* Performance regression testing and benchmarking

Working groups are crosscutting activities, bringing projects, members, and other
technical contributors together around activities that benefit the ecosystem.

You can find more information on the working groups and collaboration model in our
[launch deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZZBL9bSPNk2m23e7SffTWixTtyZxq0vo/edit#slide=id.p1).

Governance documents are in our
[governance repo on GitHub](https://github.com/hpsfoundation/foundation), including the
[HPSF Charter](https://github.com/hpsfoundation/foundation/blob/main/charter.md).
