High Performance Software Foundation (HPSF) is an open-source, vendor neutral hub for
high performance software projects, working groups, events, and training. HPSF aims to
build, promote, and advance a portable software stack for high performance computing
(HPC) by increasing adoption, lowering barriers to contribution, and supporting
development efforts. Our focus is on providing projects with the resources and
connections they need to bring their projects to maturity and to increase usage across
HPC, AI, scientific software, security, and other communities.

The Linux Foundation announced the intention to form the HPSF on November 13, 2023. From
January to May, 2024, HPSF founding members and projects met to establish a founding
charter and an initial directed fund. With that work now complete, HPSF launched at
[ISC-HPC 2024](https://app.swapcard.com/event/isc-high-performance-2024/planning/UGxhbm5pbmdfMTgyNjc4NA==).

The initial HPSF Governing Board (GB) will begin to bootstrap
[HPSF governance](http://github.com/hpsfoundation/foundation) in May, filling elected
seats and establishing an initial Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). Soon after, HPSF
will establish initial technical working groups, activities, and events.
